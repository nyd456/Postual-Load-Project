A data-driven program in Python designed to analyze postural loads using quaternion data from physical sensors

Leveraged research data gathered from program participants, provided valuable insights into understanding and managing postural health for data-driven analysis for osteoporosis and back health.

Discovered and pinpointed key physical movements causing the greatest impact to the spine which findings are to be published in academic research papers
